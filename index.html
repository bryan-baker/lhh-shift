                <h1>How defensive shifts affect left-handed hitters in Major League Baseball</h1>
                <p class='byline'>By Bryan Baker</p>
                <p>Left-handed hitters faced an infield shift in more than half of their plate appearances in 2021, nearly 40% more than right-handed hitters. Why are lefties shifted at a much higher rate than righties?</p>
                <p>A shift is a defensive realignment of fielders away from their traditional starting points. The infield shift exists to turn ground ball hits into outs. Infielders are positioned where teams think the ball will be hit. Since batted-ball data became available in 2015, teams can predict almost to a statistical certainty where batters will direct the ball.</p>
                <p>Major League hitters pull ground balls around 54% of the time and hit them up the middle about 34% of the time. This means that only about 12% of ground balls in play are hit to the opposite field. For this reason, infielders will shift toward a batter’s pull side and middle of the field, essentially daring them to hit the ball the other way.</p>
                <p>As a result, shift rates have steadily increased across Major League Baseball in the past six years.</p>
                <iframe title="Left-handed hitters are shifted at a much higher rate than right-handed hitters" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Iqxdt" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Iqxdt/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="509"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
                </script>
                <p>There is no statistical evidence that lefties pull the ball more than righties, yet they still face far more shifts.</p>
                <p>The most traditional shift against a lefty involves moving the second basemen into short right field, moving the shortstop to the right side of second base and having the third basemen replace the shortstop, shaded up the middle. This type of alignment mirrored for a righty would not work the same because the first basemen cannot stray too far from first base. He must remain near the bag for a potential putout. Shifting a righty leaves a large hole in the middle-to-opposite side of the field.</p>
                <p>Positioning the shortstop in shallow left field also requires a much longer throw to first base. Hitters have a lot more time to beat out the throw. The second baseman is able to field balls in shallow right field and still have time to throw a runner out because it is a much shorter throw.</p>
                <p>Defensive shifts seem to hurt lefties more than righties. When righties are shifted against, they still bat around the league average for ground balls in play against no shift. When lefties are shifted against, their batting average for ground balls drops well under the league average.</p>
                <iframe title="Defensive shifts affect lefties more than righties " aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Xds1L" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Xds1L/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="481"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
                </script>       
                <p>The increased use of the shift has made it harder for left-handed hitters to secure hits on ground balls. A lot of batted balls that used to be hits are now outs because fielders are positioned in the right spots.</p>        
                <p>Hitters can make adjustments and attempt to take the ball to the opposite field, away from the shift. However, they might be bailed out by a rule change coming in 2023.</p>
                <p>During MLB’s most recent lockout, the player’s union agreed to allow MLB to ban or limit defensive shifting following the 2022 season. The rule change would likely restrict teams from stacking more than two infielders on either side of second base.</p>
                <p>In the end, the defensive shift might cease to exist because it works too well against left-handed hitters.</p>
